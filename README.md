## Hi, I'm James!

This is my personal github where I showcase projects I've worked on to build my technical skills.

My career background is primarily in finance but I've always enjoyed learning about and creating more technical projects. My Masters degree in Engineering and past experience working in a Data Science Consultancy have been very helpful in that respect!

In addition to coding projects I also write, produce and perform songs (original songs and covers), so some of the projects showcased relate to the technical aspects of that - see one of my live performances!
